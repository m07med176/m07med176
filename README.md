## About me
My Name is Mohamed Arfa I am Android developer using Java and Kotlin that specialize in creating applications for the Android operating system using these programming languages. 

As an Android developer, I am responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining Android applications. I work closely with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to create applications that meet the needs of users and businesses. I am skilled in using Java and Kotlin to create high-quality code that is efficient, scalable, and maintainable.

I love :coffee:Java and Java is the most commonly used programming language for Android app development, but Kotlin has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its ease of use, improved syntax, and better compatibility with Java so now i am using Java for learning purposes like design patterns and Solving problems .

also I have a good understanding of the Android SDK (Software Development Kit), Android Studio, and other development tools and  familiar with various Android components such as activities, services, and broadcast receivers, as well as APIs of network using retrofit, volley and ktor and data persistence using Room DB and Realm.
